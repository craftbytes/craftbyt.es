# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Astro-based static website for Craftbytes, a web and mobile app
development company. The site uses Astro components with Bulma CSS framework
for styling and is currently displaying a "coming soon" page.

## Commands

### Development

- `pnpm develop` or `pnpm start` - Start development server

### Build & Deploy

- `pnpm build` - Build production site
- `pnpm serve` - Serve built site locally

### Testing

- `pnpm test` - Currently just echoes a message about writing tests.

## Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Astro 5.x** - Static site generator
- **Bulma 1.x** - CSS framework
- **SCSS** - Stylesheet preprocessor

### Project Structure

- `src/layouts/` - Astro layout components
- `src/pages/` - Astro pages (currently index.astro and 404.astro)
- `src/stylesheets/` - SCSS files with Bulma customizations
- `public/` - Static assets including logos and images

### Key Components

- `Layout.astro` component handles SEO metadata and page structure
- Uses Bulma CSS classes throughout (e.g., `hero`, `has-background-primary`, `columns`)

### Styling Architecture

- Global styles in `src/stylesheets/global.scss` import Bulma with custom overrides
- Custom variables in `_bulma_overrides.scss`
- Additional helper classes in `_helpers.scss` and `_grid.scss`
- Styles imported directly in Astro components

### Static Assets

- Images and assets served from `public/` directory
- Direct file references in Astro components (e.g., `/cb-logo-type.png`)

## Package Manager

Uses pnpm as the package manager. Use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for all commands.

## Current Status & Known Issues

### âœ… Development Server

- `pnpm develop` works successfully
- Site loads at <http://localhost:4321/>

### âœ… Production Build  

- `pnpm build` works successfully
- Astro 5.x generates static HTML files
- Static site generation completes without errors

### ðŸ“¦ Migration Changes Made

- **Migrated**: Gatsby â†’ Astro 5.x
- **Converted**: React components â†’ Astro components
- **Moved**: `src/images/` â†’ `public/` for static assets
- **Replaced**: GraphQL queries â†’ direct imports and props

## Development Guidelines

### Commit Messages

- **Always use Commitizen** (`cz commit`) for structured commit messages
- **Never mention Claude Code or AI collaboration** in commit messages
- Use `feature/astro-migration-2025` branch for Astro conversion work
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Use emojis sparingly, following existing project style (e.g., `ðŸ”¼` for upgrades)

### Git Workflow

- Create feature branches for all changes: `feature/description-YYYY`
- Use descriptive branch names with current year
- Always create PRs for code changes, never commit directly to main
