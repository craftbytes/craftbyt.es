# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Gatsby-based static website for Craftbytes, a web and mobile app development company. The site uses React components with Bulma CSS framework for styling and is currently displaying a "coming soon" page.

## Commands

### Development
- `pnpm develop` or `pnpm start` - Start development server
- `gatsby develop` - Direct Gatsby development command

### Build & Deploy
- `pnpm build` - Build production site
- `pnpm serve` - Serve built site locally

### Testing
- `pnpm test` - Currently just echoes a message about writing tests (no test framework configured)

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Gatsby 5.x** - Static site generator
- **React 18.x** - UI framework  
- **Bulma 1.x** - CSS framework
- **SCSS** - Stylesheet preprocessor via gatsby-plugin-sass

### Project Structure
- `src/components/` - Reusable React components (Header, Layout, SEO, etc.)
- `src/pages/` - Gatsby pages (currently just index.js and 404.js)
- `src/stylesheets/` - SCSS files with Bulma customizations
- `src/images/` - Static assets including logos

### Key Components
- `Layout` component wraps pages with Header and uses StaticQuery for site metadata
- `SEO` component handles meta tags and page titles
- Uses Bulma CSS classes throughout (e.g., `hero`, `has-background-primary`, `columns`)

### Styling Architecture
- Global styles in `src/stylesheets/global.scss` import Bulma with custom overrides
- Custom variables in `_bulma_overrides.scss`
- Additional helper classes in `_helpers.scss` and `_grid.scss`

### GraphQL Usage
- Site metadata queried via StaticQuery in Layout component
- Image processing through gatsby-transformer-sharp for logo display
- File system source plugin configured for src directory

## Package Manager

Uses pnpm as the package manager. Use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for all commands.

## Current Status & Known Issues

### âœ… Development Server
- `pnpm develop` works successfully
- Site loads at http://localhost:8000/
- All deprecated packages (gatsby-image, node-sass) have been replaced

### âœ… Production Build  
- `pnpm build` works successfully
- React 18.x compatibility with Gatsby 5.14.6 is stable
- Static site generation completes without errors

### ðŸ”§ Local Development Limitations
- **Sharp image processing disabled** on ARM64 Mac due to compilation issues
- Uses direct image imports (`import logo from '../images/logo.png'`) instead of optimized processing
- `gatsby-plugin-manifest` disabled to avoid Sharp dependency

### ðŸ“¦ Package Changes Made
- **Downgraded**: React 19.x â†’ React 18.x for Gatsby compatibility
- **Replaced**: `gatsby-image` â†’ direct image imports
- **Replaced**: `node-sass` â†’ `sass`
- **Removed**: Sharp-dependent plugins for local development

### ðŸš€ For Ubuntu Deployment
The Sharp compilation issue is macOS ARM64 specific. For Ubuntu deployment:

1. **Re-enable image optimization**:
   ```js
   // In gatsby-config.js, add back:
   `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
   `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, 
   `gatsby-plugin-image`,
   ```

2. **Update components** to use GatsbyImage instead of direct imports

3. **Add PWA manifest** back if needed:
   ```js
   {
     resolve: `gatsby-plugin-manifest`,
     options: { /* your manifest config */ }
   }
   ```

Sharp will compile correctly on Ubuntu with standard Python/Node setup.
